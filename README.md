# Python-GUI-Sorting-Project

Python GUI project, that includes the main Algorithms and Data Structures learned during the "Algorithms of AI" course in the University of Palermo.

This project implements:
1. Sorting Algorithms: MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort, BubbleSort, CountingSort.
2. Performance testing for each of the algorithms.
3. Three types of hash tables: Chaining, Open Addressing (Double Hashing), Linear Probing.
4. Performance testing for each of the hash tables types.
5. Linked lists.
6. BSTs.
